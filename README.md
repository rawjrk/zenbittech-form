# zenbittech-form

Test task.

## Some Important Notes

1. Font **Apercu Arabic Pro** is distributed under paid license, so used for
   this project **HK Grotesk** as a free analog.
2. Created only **Index**, **Show** and **New** API endpoints. The last one is
   neccessary for a form submission functionality, while others are only needed
   to check whether the API is saving requests to DB.

## Deployed App

- front: https://clever-jelly-827ba2.netlify.app/
- back: https://glacial-brook-85348.herokuapp.com/

## Backend API Endpoints

- `GET /request/` to show all requests (index)
- `GET /request/:id` to show a specific request
- `POST /request/` to create a new request
